# VM

This is a Vagrant machine setup that will set me up for Rails development. It uses the [precise64 box](https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/precise64) and [puppet provisioning](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/puppet_apply.html) to set up Rails, all of it's dependencies, PostgreSQL, dev tools like git, oh-my-zsh as the shell, my dotfiles, and more.
